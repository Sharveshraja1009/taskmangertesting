# taskmangertesting
I want to test the taskmanger application which is run on python.

here the main feature of this application like 
            -->Add task
            -->Mark as complete
            -->view completed task
            -->exit

The testing part of this application consists of,
--> script automates the testing of key functionalities in your Tkinter task manager app, including adding, editing, removing, and filtering tasks. 
-->It simulates user interactions and checks if the application behaves as expected, ensuring that the core features are working correctly.
